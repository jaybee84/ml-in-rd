## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Substantial technological advances have dramatically changed biomedicine by making deep characterization of patient samples routine. 
These technologies provide a rich portrait of genes, cellular pathways, and cell types involved in complex phenotypes. 
Machine learning is often a perfect fit for the types of data now being generated, and Nature Methods routinely has reports of machine learning methods that extract disease-relevant patterns from these high dimensional datasets. 
Often, these methods require a large number of samples to identify reproducible and biologically meaningful patterns. 
With rare diseases, biological specimens and consequently data, are limited due to the rarity of the condition. 
In this perspective, we outline the challenges and emerging solutions for using machine learning in these settings. 
We aim to spur the development of powerful machine learning techniques for rare diseases. 
We also note that precision medicine presents a similar challenge, in which a common disease is partitioned into small subsets of patients with shared etiologies and treatment strategies. 
Advances from rare disease research are likely to be highly informative for other applications as well.
