The advent of high-throughput profiling methods such as genomics, transcriptomics, and other technologies has accelerated basic research and made deep characterization of patient samples routine.
These approaches provide a rich portrait of genes, cellular pathways, and cell types involved in complex phenotypes.
Machine learning is often a perfect fit for extracting disease-relevant patterns from these high dimensional datasets.
Often, machine learning methods require many samples to identify reproducible and biologically meaningful patterns.
With rare diseases, biological specimens, and consequently data, are limited due to the rarity of the condition.
In this perspective, we outline the challenges and emerging solutions for using machine learning in rare disease settings.
We also note that precision medicine presents a similar challenge, in which a common disease is partitioned into small subsets of patients with shared etiologies and treatment strategies. [TODO: Are we still talking about precision medicine? I thought we decided against that?]
Advances from rare disease research are likely to be highly informative for other applications as well, and we propose that the methods community should prioritize the development of machine learning techniques for rare disease research.
