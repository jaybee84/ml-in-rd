The advent of high-throughput profiling methods such as genomics, transcriptomics, and other technologies has accelerated basic research and made deep characterization of patient samples routine.
These approaches provide a rich portrait of genes, cellular pathways, and cell types involved in complex phenotypes.
Machine learning is often a perfect fit for extracting disease-relevant patterns from these high dimensional datasets.
However, machine learning methods require a large number of samples to identify recurrent and biologically meaningful patterns.
With rare diseases, biological specimens, and consequently data, are inherently limited due to the rarity of the condition.
Precision medicine also presents a similar challenge, where a common disease is partitioned into small subsets of patients with limited amount of data in each subset. 
In this perspective, we outline the challenges and emerging solutions for using machine learning in the context of small sample sets, specifically that of rare diseases.
Advances from research of machine learning methods for rare disease are likely to be highly informative for applications well beyond rare diseases. 
We propose that the methods community prioritize development of machine learning techniques for rare disease research.
