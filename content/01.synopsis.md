## Abstract {.page_break_before}

The advent of high-throughput profiling methods such as genomics and other technologies has accelerated basic research and made deep molecular characterization of patient samples routine. 
These approaches provide a rich portrait of genes, molecular pathways, and cell types involved in disease phenotypes. 
Machine learning (ML) can be a useful tool to extract disease-relevant patterns from high dimensional datasets. 
However, depending on the complexity of the biological question, machine learning often requires a large number of samples to identify recurrent and biologically meaningful patterns. 
Rare diseases are inherently limited in clinical cases and thus have few samples to study.
In this perspective, we outline the challenges and emerging solutions for using machine learning in the context of small sample sets, specifically that of rare diseases. 
Advances in machine learning methods for rare disease are likely to be informative for applications beyond rare diseases in which sample sizes are small but datasets are high-dimensional (e.g., using genomics data for predictive modeling in precision medicine). 
We propose that the methods community prioritizes the development of machine learning techniques for rare disease research.
