### Techniques to manage disparities in data generation are required to power robust analyses in rare diseases
>Rarity of patients leads to heterogeneity in sample collection, causing disparities in the data. 
>We will discuss how rigorous normalization and methodologies capturing sample-wise gene-set level information can help appropriate integration of disparate data points to power machine learning approaches11â€“13.
