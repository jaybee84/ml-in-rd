### Techniques to manage disparities in data generation are required to power robust analyses in rare diseases

As with common diseases, genomic and transcriptomic data from rare diseases can suffer from artifacts introduced by batch, processing methodology, sequencing platform, or other non-biological phenomena. 
This effect is amplified in rare diseases which often have few samples and heterogenous phenotypes.
Furthermore, because datasets are many times pieced together from multiple small studies, disease phenotype or other important biological characteristics are often confounded by the previously mentioned "batch" factors. 
Consequently, careful assessment of confounding factors and implementation of normalization methods is important to identifying biologically meaningful features within a dataset.

A variety of dimensionality reduction methods are can be used to visualize sample heterogeneity and potential confounding variables, including multidimensional scaling (MDS), principal components analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE), and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), among many others. [@doi:10.1007/978-3-540-33037-0_14; @doi:10.1098/rsta.2015.0202; @https://lvdmaaten.github.io/publications/papers/JMLR_2008.pdf; @arXiv:1802.03426]
All of these methods can be effectively used to identify batch effects (cite), though some, like tSNE and UMAP, have parameters that can substantially effect the output, and thus the interpretation, of the analysis [@doi:10.23915/distill.00002;@arXiv:1802.03426]. 
Therefore, successful application of these methods requires s aufficient understanding of the underlying method and parameter sweeping to get a clear picture of the structure of the underlying data. 
examples of techniques to fix heterogeneity:
-preprocessing gene expression data to correct batch effects
-reprocessing gene variant data using a common pipeline
-an acknowledgement that imperfect situations/imperfectly designed experiments will happen, and that it's a limitation of working with rare disease
