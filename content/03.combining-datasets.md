### Constructing machine learning-ready rare disease datasets

High-throughput 'omic' data methods generate high-dimensional data or data with many features, regardless of the underlying disease or condition being assayed.
A typical rare disease dataset is comprised of a small number of samples [@doi:10.1186/s13023-020-01424-6].
A lack of samples gives rise to the “curse of dimensionality” (i.e., few samples but many features), which can contribute to the poor performance of models [@doi:10.1038/nrc2294] [TODO: reference new figure as appropriate #186].
More features often means increased missing observations (_sparsity_), more dissimilarity between samples, and increased redundancy between individual features or combinations of features [@doi:10.1038/s41592-018-0019-x], all of which contribute to a challenging prediction problem.

If a small sample size compromises an ML model's performance, then an intuitive solution is to increase the number of samples.  
An individual rare disease cohort may be necessarily small, but appropriate training, testing and validation sets could be constructed by combining multiple cohorts [TODO: Link to experimental design box #185].
In fact, this is often required for the study of rare diseases in the authors' experience.
Not only can data collection differ from cohort to cohort, but the aggregation methods selected can introduce technical variability which can negatively impact researchers ability to learn or detect meaningful signal.
Steps such as reprocessing the data using a single pipeline, using batch correction methods [@doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxj037; @doi:10.1093/nar/gku864], and normalizing raw values [@doi:10.1186/gb-2010-11-3-r25] may be necessary to mitigate unwanted technical variability.

In the next section, we will discuss approaches that can aid in identifying and visualizing structure in datasets.
Ideally, structure in the composite datasets under study will be aligned with variables of interest, such as phenotype labels if available; if instead samples from the same cohort tend to group together regardless of phenotype, revisiting the construction of the dataset is warranted.
