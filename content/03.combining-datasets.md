### Combining datasets

In rare diseases, the high throughput ‘omic’ methods generate high dimensional data – data with many features, such as all of the mRNA transcripts in a sample – from a small number of samples.
A lack of samples gives rise to the “curse of dimensionality” (i.e., few samples but many features), which is an impediment in analyzing feature-rich data in sample-deficient contexts such as rare disease [@doi:10.1038/nrc2294] (Figure {@fig:1}A-B).
In particular, increasing the number of features can result in increased sparsity (missing observations), more dissimilarity between samples, and increased redundancy between individual features or combinations of features [@doi:10.1038/s41592-018-0019-x], all of which combine to create a challenging prediction problem. 
Furthermore, rare disease data collection and aggregation methods can add to these challenges by introducing technical variability into the data at hand.
In this section, we will discuss strategies for reducing the feature space and addressing technical artifacts through dimensionality reduction.
