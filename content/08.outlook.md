### Outlook

Throughout this perspective we have highlighted various challenges in applying ML methods to rare disease data as well as examples of approaches that address these challenges.
The low number of samples while significant is not the only roadblock towards application of ML in rare disease data.
The high dimensionality of the data collected using modern techniques necessitates the management of the curse of dimensionality in creative ways by learning low dimensional representations from the data.
It further requires leveraging prior knowledge and transfer learning instead of using traditional machiine learning methods for appropriate interpretation of data. 
Lastly, anyone applying machine learning methods on rare disease data is advised to delve into fundamental techniques that increase confidence and penalize complexity of the resultant models to enhance generalizabilty of ML in rare disease.
All of the approaches highlighted in this perspective come with certain challenges or inadequacies that breed mistrust in using these powerful techniques in rare disease.
We believe that the same challenges that are currently outlined as major pitfalls in applying ML to rare disease can be great opportunities for data generation as well as method development in moving the field forward.
During our journey through the various challenges, we identified two major areas where mindful strategies can immeasurably enhance the power of machine learning in rare disease and move the field forward.

_Emphasis on not just "more n" but "more meaningful n"._

Mindful addition of data is key for powering the next generation of analysis in rare disease data.
While there are many techniques to collate rare data from different sources, incorrect data generation may hurt the end goal even if it adds to the size of the dataset.
In our experience collaboration with domain experts have proved to be critical in gaining insight into potential sources of variation in the datasets.
As an example, an neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) dataset generated contained samples collected using vastly different surgical techniques (laser ablation and excision vs standard excision). [@doi:10.3390/genes11020226] 
While the integrative analysis in the study using transfer learning techniques was able to minimize technique related signals [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003], a more traditional analysis may have resulted in surfacing of substantial biological differences that are a consequence of process (e.g. activation of heat shock protein related pathways), not disease related biology. 
This data is still valuable for secondary analysis, but continuous collaboration with domain experts is needed to generate robust datasets in the future.
A few such collaborations are beginning to show promise in generating valuable datasets for future use.[@https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/kimmel_cancer_center/cancers_we_treat/pediatric_oncology/research_and_clinical_trials/pratilas/nf1_biospecimen_repository.html]

Rare disease not only lacks samples, there is also a great dearth of comprehensive phenotypic-genotypic databases. 
With the ubiquity of sequencing platforms, genomic data has been easy to gather for rare disease patients.
An important next step would be to integrate genomic and clinical data to produce comprehensive phenotypic-genotypic databases that can fuel interpretation of features extracted using ML methods.
[TODO: add Refs]

Finally, mindful sharing of data with proper metadata and attribution to enable prompt data reuse is of utmost important in building datasets that can be of great value in rare disease. [@https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-020-0257-5]
[TODO: expand on this]


_Development of methods that reliably support mechanistic interrogation of specific rare diseases_

A pattern that emerged readily in our quest for examples of application of ML methods in rare disease is that most ML related strategies were focused on classification of a patient as a rare disease patient among other non-rare disease patients.
We found that examples of methodologies interrogating mechanistic details of a specific rare disease were particularly lacking.
Reasons for this include not only the lack of large datasets, but also lack of reliability or interpretability of the results from such analyses.
We believe that an intentional push towards developing methods or analytical workflows that address this would be critical in encouraging powerful analyses using rare disease data.

In thinking of method development with rare disease applications in mind, the developers will have to bear the responsibility of ensuring that the resulting model is _trustworthy_.
The field of natural language processing has a few examples of how this can be achieved.[@https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N16-3020.pdf, @https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1073.pdf]
One way to increase user's trust on a developed model is by helping the user understand the behavior of the developed model through providing explanations regarding why a certain model made certain predictions.[@https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N16-3020.pdf]
Another approach is to provide robust _error analysis_ for newly developed models to help users understand the strengths and weaknesses of a model.[@https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1073.pdf, @https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/COLI_a_00072, @doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bth060]
Adoption of these kind of approaches into biological data and analysis is still rare but is quickly becoming necessary as machine learning approaches become mainstream in biomedicine.

Can strategies/methods exploiting "anchoring" help rare disease data analysis [https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)30559-8] ? Future direction?]
