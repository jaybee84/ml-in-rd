### Outlook

Throughout this perspective we have highlighted various challenges in applying ML methods to rare disease data as well as examples of approaches that address these challenges.
We believe that the same challenges that are currently outlined as major pitfalls in applying ML to rare disease can be great opportunities for data generation as well as method development in moving the field forward.

_Emphasis on not just "more n" but "more meaningful n"._

Mindful addition of data is key for powering the next generation of analysis in rare disease data.
While there are many techniques to collate rare data from different sources, incorrect data generation may hurt the end goal even if it adds to the size of the dataset.
In our experience collaboration with domain experts have proved to be critical in gaining insight into potential sources of variation in the datasets.
As an example, in a study of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) datasets, the datasets were, unbeknownst to the computational biologists, generated from samples obtained with vastly different surgical techniques (laser ablation and excision vs standard excision). [@doi:10.3390/genes11020226] 
This resulted in surfacing of substantial biological differences that are a consequence of process (e.g. activation of heat shock protein related pathways), not disease related biology. 



For example : comprehensive phenotypic-genotypic databases or machine learning methods that integrate genomic and EHR data might be important next steps

Can strategies/methods exploiting "anchoring" help rare disease data analysis [https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)30559-8] ? Future direction?





highlight the two camps of ml-in-rd: methods used successfully for classification of disease landscape (and identification of rare disease in general, not a particular one) and methods used for mechanistic interrogation for a particular rare disease. 
While both have few examples, the emphasis so far have been on the former, while there is a great opportunity of developing new methods to tackle the latter harder problem.
