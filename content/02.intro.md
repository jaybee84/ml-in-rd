## Introduction {.page_break_before}

Rare disease researchers increasingly depend on machine learning (ML) to analyze high-dimensional datasets. 
A systematic review of ML applications in rare diseases (as defined in the European Union, i.e. fewer than 5 patients per 10,000 people) uncovered 211 human studies that used ML to study 74 different rare diseases over the last 10 years.[@doi:10.1186/s13023-020-01424-6] 
Indeed, ML can be a powerful tool in biomedical research but it does not come without pitfalls, some of which are magnified in a rare disease context.[@doi:10.3389/fmed.2021.747612]
In this perspective, we discuss considerations for using two types of ML – supervised and unsupervised learning – in the study of rare diseases, with a specific focus on high-dimensional molecular data.

ML algorithms are computational methods that identify patterns in data, and use information about these patterns to perform tasks (e.g., pick out important data points or predict unknown outcomes). 
_Supervised learning_ algorithms must be trained with data that has specific phenotypes or patient outcome labels. 
Supervised methods can learn correlations of features (e.g., expression measurements of a large number of genes) with the outcome labels to predict the outcome in unseen or new data, such as predicting which patients will or will not respond to treatment. 
Therefore, if a study aims to classify patients with a rare disease into well-known molecular subtypes based on high-throughput molecular profiling, a supervised ML algorithm is appropriate to carry out this task. 
Conversely, unsupervised learning algorithms learn patterns or features from unlabeled training data. 
In the absence of known molecular subtypes, unsupervised ML approaches can be applied to identify groups of samples that are similar and may have distinct patterns of pathway activation [@doi:10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2100].
Unsupervised approaches can also extract combinations of features (e.g., genes) that may describe a certain cell type or pathway.
See Box 1 for more examples of how ML can be used in rare disease research.

While ML can be a useful tool, there are challenges in applying ML to rare disease datasets. 
ML methods are generally most effective when using large datasets; thus analyzing high dimensional biomedical data (i.e. data with typically > 1000 features, e.g. 20,000 genes) from rare diseases datasets that typically contain 20 to 99 samples is challenging[@https://www.fda.gov/media/99546/download; @doi:10.1186/s13023-020-01424-6].
Small datasets tend to lack statistical power and magnify the susceptibility of ML to misinterpretation and unstable performance. 
For example, with insufficient data, an unsupervised model will fail to identify patterns that are useful for biological discovery (i.e. “perform” poorly). 
Similarly, supervised models require datasets where the phenotype labels have very little uncertainty (or “label-noise”) [@doi:10.1093/jamia/ocw028] – termed "gold standard" datasets. 
Datasets with high label-noise decrease prediction accuracy and necessitate larger sample sizes during training [@doi:10.1109/tnnls.2013.2292894].
Rare disease datasets often come with significant label-noise (e.g., silver standard datasets) due to limited understanding of the underlying biology or evolving clinical classifications. 
Additionally, a supervised ML model is of limited utility if it can only accurately predict phenotype labels in the data it was trained on, also known as overfitting. 
Instead, most researchers aspire to develop models that generalize or maintain performance when applied to new data that has not yet been “seen” by the model.

While we expect ML in rare disease research to continue to increase in popularity, specialized computational methods that can learn patterns from small datasets and can generalize to newly acquired data are required for rare disease applications [@doi:10.1016/j.ebiom.2019.08.027]. 
In this perspective, we first highlight approaches that address or better tolerate the limitations of rare disease data, and then discuss the future of ML applications in rare disease.
