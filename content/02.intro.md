## Introduction {.page_break_before}

Rare disease research is increasingly dependent on high-throughput profiling of samples and would greatly benefit from applications of machine learning (ML) in their analysis. 
Analyzing such high dimensional data from rare diseases (fewer than 200,000 cases in the United States [@https://www.fda.gov/media/99546/download]) is challenging, as datasets typically range from 20 to 99 samples [@doi:10.1186/s13023-020-01424-6].
Specialized computational methods that can learn patterns from small datasets that can be generalized to newly acquired data are required [@doi:10.1016/j.ebiom.2019.08.027]. 
Lack of statistical power and the susceptibility of ML methods to misinterpretation and unstable performance pose challenges when datasets are small.
Heterogeneity in available data creates additional difficulties. 
For example, successful training of ML models require training datasets made of “gold standard” data where the diagnosis or label of a data point has very little uncertainty (or “label-noise”) associated with it [@doi:10.1093/jamia/ocw028]. 
Due to the limited understanding of the biology of rare diseases, the symptoms or disease labels often come with a reasonable amount label-noise leading to a silver standard dataset [@doi:10.1109/tnnls.2013.2292894]. 
A systematic review of application of ML in rare disease in the last 10 years uncovered 211 human data studies in 74 different rare diseases employing ensemble methods (36.0%), support vector machines (32.2%) and artificial neural networks (31.8%) [@doi:10.1186/s13023-020-01424-6]. 
The review also showed that most studies used ML for diagnosis (40.8%) or prognosis (38.4%), but studies aiming to improve treatment were infrequent (4.7%) [@doi:10.1186/s13023-020-01424-6]. 
Moreover, in the context of rare disease, special considerations need to be made to safeguard against misinterpretation of results. 
Rare disease datasets are often limited in size and/or assembled from combining data from multiple institutions  from differently processed specimens collected with geographical and chronological disparity. 
Consequently, data analysis techniques must be robust to challenges posed by small sample sizes, as well as technical artifacts present in aggregated data. In this perspective, we discuss techniques for understanding the nature of rare disease data, including those that address or better tolerate the limitations of these data.
