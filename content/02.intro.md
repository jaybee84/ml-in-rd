## Introduction {.page_break_before}

Machine learning (ML) is gaining momentum in biomedical data analysis as data collection becomes increasingly high-throughput and as novel computational methods for exploring those data are developed. 
Next generation sequencing, automated imaging of histopathology, and non-invasive imaging technologies like MRI, and other 'omics analyses have led to the collection of patient data that is extremely information rich (i.e. the number of detected features exceed the samples by orders of magnitude). 
Parsing such high dimensional data requires computational methods that can learn from the data and can also be applied to newly acquired data in the same disease space [@doi:10.1016/j.ebiom.2019.08.027]. 
Such computational methods comprise of machine learning algorithms including (i) supervised learning (ii) unsupervised learning, or (iii) reinforcement learning [@http://cds.cern.ch/record/998831/files/9780387310732_TOC.pdf]. 


Application of ML to any dataset requires careful execution, but the application to biomedical data and subsequent interpretation requires depth of knowledge not only in the biomedical domain but also a clear understanding of the methods and their underlying assumptions.
Application of ML to any kind of data consists of the following major steps: (1) data evaluation and question formulation, (2) selection of normalization/dimension reduction to mitigate technical differences, (3) selection of appropriate algorithms which select features to answer the formulated question, (4) evaluation of the answers generated by the algorithm. 
Each of these steps require the practitioner to choose from a variety of methodologies to apply. 
The selection of the methodologies at each of these steps need to be based upon robust reasoning to ensure stability of the results. 

A promising yet challenging application of machine learning is in the study of rare diseases - those with fewer than 200,000 cases in the United States or fewer than 1 in 2,000 people in Europe [@https://www.fda.gov/media/99546/download; @pmid:3358420; @doi:10.1136/jmg.14.5.316; @doi:10.1155/2017/8327980].
Rare disease research has substantial constraints to consider when using ML methods, including lack of statistical power in dataset size, heterogeneity in available data, and sensitivity of ML methods to misinterpretation in view of small datasets. 
For example, successful training of ML models require training datasets made of "gold standard" data where the diagnosis or label of a data point has very little uncertainty (or "label-noise") associated with it [@doi:10.1093/jamia/ocw028]. 
In rare disease the symptoms as well as any underlying biology often come with a reasonable amount label-noise leading to a _silver standard_ dataset[@doi:10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2292894, @doi:10.1093/jamia/ocw028].
Moreover, in the context of rare disease, special considerations need to be made to safeguard against misinterpretation of results.
Such considerations include incorporation of methods that can mitigate technical disparities in the data, methods that are resilient to challenges posed by small datasets, and techniques that build upon prior domain-specific knowledge.
Recent advances in methodologies to accommodate rarity of samples and increased transparency in model outputs have encouraged application of ML in rare diseases.
In this perspective, we discuss techniques for understanding the nature of rare disease data, methods for addressing some of the limitations of these data, and ML methods that can tolerate some of these limitations.
