## Introduction {.page_break_before}

Machine learning is gaining momentum in analysis of biomedical data as the data collection leans increasingly towards high dimensionality data and the algorithmic applications become increasingly transparent and interpretable. 

Application of machine learning to any dataset is complicated but the complexity of applying these to biomedical dataset is enormous. 
The proper application and interpretation requires depth of knowledge not only in the biomedical domain but also a clear understanding of the methods and the underlying assumptions of each of the methods.

Rare disease has not benefitted significantly from machine learning applications yet due to various reasons including lack of statistical power in dataset size, heterogeneity in available data, and sensitivity of machine learning methods to misinterpretation in view of small datasets. 
However recent advances in the methodologies to accomodate rarity of samples and increased transparency in model outputs have encouraged application of machine learning in rare disease.
We anticipate higher occurrence of such applications in the near future and aim to highlight the current state-of-art in this perspective.

Application of machine learning to any kind of data consists of the following major steps: (1) data evaluation and question formulation, (2) selection of normalization/dimension reduction to mitigate technical differences, (3) selection of appropriate algorithms to answer the formulated question, (4) evaluation of the answers generated by the algorithm. 
Each of these steps require the user to choose from a variety of methodologies to apply. 
The selection of the methodologies at each of these steps need to be based upon robust reasoning to ensure stability of the results. 
Moreover, in the context of rare diseases, special considerations need to be made at each of the above mentioned steps to safeguard against misinterpretation of data.
Such considerations include incorporation of techniques that build upon prior domain-specific knowledge, methods that are resilient to challenges posed by small datasets, and methods that can mitigate technical disparities in the data.
