## Introduction {.page_break_before}

Rare disease researchers are increasingly dependent on machine learning to analyze complex datasets.
A systematic review of the application of ML in rare diseases uncovered 211 human data studies that used ML to study 74 different rare diseases over the last 10 years.[@doi:10.1186/s13023-020-01424-6] 
Indeed, ML can be a powerful tool in biomedical research but it does not come without pitfalls, some of which are magnified in a rare disease context.[@doi:10.3389/fmed.2021.747612]
In this perspective, we will discuss considerations for using two types of ML (supervised and unsupervised learning) in the context of the study of rare diseases.

ML algorithms are computational methods that can identify patterns in data, and can use information about these patterns to perform tasks (e.g., pick out important data points or predict outcomes when they are not yet known). 
_Supervised learning_ algorithms must be trained with data that has specific phenotype or outcome labels (e.g., in a clinical study: complete response, partial response, or progressive disease). 
Supervised methods can learn correlations of features with the outcome labels to predict the outcome in unseen or new test data (e.g., predicting which patients would or would not respond to treatment).
Therefore, if the goal of a study is to classify patients with a rare disease into well-known molecular subtypes based on high-throughput profiling, a supervised ML algorithm would be appropriate to carry out this task. 
Conversely, _unsupervised learning_ algorithms can learn patterns or features from _unlabeled_ training data.
In the absence of known molecular subtypes, unsupervised ML approaches can be applied to identify groups of samples that are similar and may have distinct patterns of pathway activation [@doi:10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2100].
Unsupervised approaches can also extract combinations of features (e.g., genes) that are indicative of a certain cell type or pathway.

While ML can be a useful tool, there are challenges in applying ML to rare disease datasets. 
ML methods are generally most effective when using large datasets; analyzing high dimensional data from rare diseases datasets that typically contain 20 to 99 samples is challenging [@https://www.fda.gov/media/99546/download; @doi:10.1186/s13023-020-01424-6].
Small datasets lead to a lack of statistical power and magnify the susceptibility of ML methods to misinterpretation and unstable performance.
For example, with insufficient data, an unsupervised model will fail to identify patterns that are useful for biological discovery.
Similarly, supervised models require datasets where the phenotype labels have very little uncertainty (or “label-noise”) [@doi:10.1093/jamia/ocw028] – termed "gold standard" datasets. 
Datasets with high label-noise decrease prediction accuracy and necessitate larger sample sizes during training [@doi:10.1109/tnnls.2013.2292894], and rare disease datasets often come with significant label-noise (e.g., _silver standard_ datasets) due to limited understanding of the underlying biology or evolving clinical classifications.
Additionally, a supervised ML model is of limited utility if it can only accurately predict phenotype labels in the data it was trained on (also known as _overfitting_); instead, most researchers aspire to develop models that _generalize_ or maintain performance when applied to new data that has not yet been "seen" by the model.

While we expect ML in rare disease research to continue to increase in popularity, specialized computational methods that can learn patterns from small datasets and can generalize to newly acquired data are required for rare disease applications [@doi:10.1016/j.ebiom.2019.08.027]. 
In this perspective, we first highlight approaches that address or better tolerate the limitations of rare disease data, and then discuss the future of ML applications in rare disease.
