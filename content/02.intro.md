## Introduction {.page_break_before}

Machine learning is gaining momentum in biomedical data analysis as data collection becomes increasingly high-throughput and as novel computational methods for exploring those data are developed. 
Application of machine learning to any dataset requires careful execution, but the application to biomedical data and subsequent interpretation requires depth of knowledge not only in the biomedical domain but also a clear understanding of the methods and their underlying assumptions.
Application of machine learning to any kind of data consists of the following major steps: (1) data evaluation and question formulation, (2) selection of normalization/dimension reduction to mitigate technical differences, (3) selection of appropriate algorithms which select features to answer the formulated question, (4) evaluation of the answers generated by the algorithm. 
Each of these steps require the practitioner to choose from a variety of methodologies to apply. 
The selection of the methodologies at each of these steps need to be based upon robust reasoning to ensure stability of the results. 

Rare disease research has additional constraints to consider when using machine learning methods, including lack of statistical power in dataset size, heterogeneity in available data, and sensitivity of machine learning methods to misinterpretation in view of small datasets. 
Moreover, in the context of rare disease, special considerations need to be made to safeguard against misinterpretation of results.
Such considerations include incorporation of techniques that build upon prior domain-specific knowledge, methods that are resilient to challenges posed by small datasets, and methods that can mitigate technical disparities in the data.
Recent advances in the methodologies to accommodate rarity of samples and increased transparency in model outputs have encouraged application of machine learning in rare disease. 
We aim to discuss some of these challenges and recent advances in this perspective.
