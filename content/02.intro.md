## Introduction {.page_break_before}

Rare disease research, as with many other biomedical domains, is increasingly using high-throughput profiling methods to better understand the mechanisms of the disease. 
These profiling methods, including RNA sequencing (RNA-seq, whole genome sequencing, imaging data, electronic health record data, among others, generate large and complex data. 
The analysis of such complex data from rare disease will require machine learning (ML)-based methodologies to assist in the modeling and interpretation of this data. 
Indeed, a systematic review of application of ML in rare disease in the last 10 years uncovered 211 human data studies in 74 different rare diseases employing ensemble methods (36.0%), support vector machines (32.2%) and artificial neural networks (31.8%) [@doi:10.1186/s13023-020-01424-6]. 
While this review points to the increasing popularity of ML methods in rare disease, there are various hurdles that are inherent to such datasets.
ML based methods benefit from large sample sizes, rare disease datasets typically contain fewer than one hundred samples [@doi:10.1186/s13023-020-01424-6].
Small datasets lead to a lack of statistical power and magnify the susceptibility of ML methods to misinterpretation and unstable performance.
Additionally, successful training of ML models require training datasets made of “gold standard” data where the diagnosis or label of a data point has very little uncertainty (or “label-noise”) associated with it [@doi:10.1093/jamia/ocw028]. 
Due to limited understanding of the biology of rare diseases, the symptoms or disease labels often come with significant label-noise (a _silver standard_ dataset) [@doi:10.1109/tnnls.2013.2292894]. 
Thus, specialized computational methods that can learn patterns from small datasets and can generalize to newly acquired data are required for rare disease applications [@doi:10.1016/j.ebiom.2019.08.027]. 
In this perspective, we first highlight ML approaches that address or better tolerate the limitations of rare disease data, and then discuss the future of ML applications in rare disease.
