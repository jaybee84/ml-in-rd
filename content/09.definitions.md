## Definitions {.page_break_before}

### Unsupervised learning: 
Machine learning algorithms which can learn features from unlabeled training data (e.g. datasets where the samples do not have disease or phenotype labels) to predict the class or phenotype of new or unseen test data are part of unsupervised learning. Examples of unsupervised learning include principal component analyses, multidimensional scaling, UMAP, t-SNE, and k-means clustering [@doi:10.1007/978-3-540-33037-0; @doi:10.1098/rsta.2015.0202, @https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v9/vandermaaten08a.html; @https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426, @https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bsmsp/1200512992].

### Supervised learning: 
Machine learning algorithms that require training data with specific phenotype labels are part of supervised learning. 
Such algorithms learn correlations of features with the phenotype labels and use the learned correlations to predict the phenotype labels of unseen or new test data.

### VAE: 
Variational Autoencoders or VAEs are unsupervised neural networks that use hidden layers to learn or encode representations from available data while mapping the input data to the output data. 
VAEs are distinct from other autoencoders since the distribution of the encodings are regularized such that they are close to a normal distribution, which may contribute to learning more biologically relevant signals [@doi:10.1186/s13059-020-02021-3].
