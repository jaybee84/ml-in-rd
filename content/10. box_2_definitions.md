### VAE 
Variational Autoencoders or VAEs are unsupervised neural networks that use hidden layers to learn or encode representations from available data while mapping the input data to the output data. 
VAEs are distinct from other autoencoders since the distribution of the encodings are regularized such that they are close to a normal distribution, which may contribute to learning more biologically relevant signals [@doi:10.1186/s13059-020-02021-3].
