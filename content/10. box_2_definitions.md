### VAE 
Variational Autoencoders or VAEs are unsupervised neural networks that use hidden layers to learn or encode representations from available data while mapping the input data to the output data. 
VAEs are distinct from other autoencoders since the distribution of the encodings are regularized such that they are close to a normal distribution, which may contribute to learning more biologically relevant signals [@doi:10.1186/s13059-020-02021-3].

### Machine Learning

Machine learning is a scientific discipline at the intersection of computer science and statistics, which combines computational and statistical methods to identify patterns in sample data.[@https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-21606-5, @doi:10.1038/s41580-021-00407-0]
In this discipline, one intends to use data as input and apply or fit predictive models to recognize patterns in the data or identify informative groups among the data using objective computational methods.

### Transfer Learning
Transfer learning is an approach where a model trained for one task or domain (source domain) is applied to another, typically related task or domain (target domain), for example a model pre-trained natural images from the ImageNet dataset can potentially be used to classify medical images.[@doi:10.1109/TMI.2016.2528162]
Transfer learning can be supervised (one or both of the source and target domains have labels), or unsupervised (both domains are unlabeled).

### Regularization
Regularization is an approach to reduce overfitting of models to training data, where a penalty or constraint is added to a model trained on a training dataset to avoid making large prediction errors on the evaluation dataset.
