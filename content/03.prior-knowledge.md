### Techniques that build on prior knowledge and indirectly related data are necessary for many rare disease applications

We focus on a series of approaches that are centered on the following concept: to realize the potential of machine learning for biological discovery in rare diseases, we can not study an individual rare disease alone.
We must instead build on prior knowledge and large volumes of data that do not directly assay our disease of interest, but are closely-enough related to be valuable for discovery.
We can leverage shared features, whether they are biological patterns that are a normal part of development aberrant in a particular disease context or an imaging anomaly present in both rare and common diseases, for advancing our understanding.
We discuss transfer learning or domain adaptation, multitask learning, and few-shot learning approaches below.

* Transfer learning example - mention how representation learning or feature construction can be related/part of this approach
* Multitask learning example
* Few-shot learning example

<!--The section I'm outlining below may need to be moved as the manuscript matures-->

To be successful, machine learning approaches in rare diseases likely require the inclusion _multiple strategies_ discussed throughout.

PLIER and MultiPLIER studies as examples 
* Representation learning from an arbitrary, large set of gene expression data
* Prior knowledge
* Regularization
