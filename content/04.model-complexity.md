### Techniques and procedures must be implemented to manage model complexity without sacrificing the value of machine learning
Inherent challenges posed by low sample numbers in rare diseases are further aggravated by disease heterogeneity, poorly defined disease phenotypes, and often a lack of control (i.e. normal) data. 
Machine learning approaches must be carefully designed to address these challenges. 
We discuss how to implement methodological solutions like bootstrapping sample data, regularization methods for deep learning, and hyper-ensemble techniques to minimize misinterpretation of the data.
