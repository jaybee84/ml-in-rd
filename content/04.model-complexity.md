### Techniques and procedures must be implemented to manage model complexity without sacrificing the value of machine learning
>Inherent challenges posed by low sample numbers in rare diseases are further aggravated by disease heterogeneity, poorly defined disease phenotypes, and often a lack of control (i.e. normal) data. 
>Machine learning approaches must be carefully designed to address these challenges. 
>We discuss how to implement methodological solutions like bootstrapping sample data, regularization methods for deep learning, and hyper-ensemble techniques to minimize misinterpretation of the data9,10.
