### Techniques that build on prior knowledge and indirectly related data are necessary for many rare disease applications
>This section will highlight promising approaches for analyzing rare disease data to extract biological insights. 
>We will discuss techniques like transfer learning, representation learning, cascade learning, integrative analysis, and knowledge-graph creation and use that leverage other knowledge and data sources to construct testable hypotheses from rare diseases datasets with limited sample sizes 1â€“8.
