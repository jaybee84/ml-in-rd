### Knowledge graphs for rare disease

An intrinsic constraint in the study of rare disease is the availablility of large, normalized datasets. 
This limits our ability to study genotype-phenotype relationships or other key attributes of rare diseases. 
A potentially powerful strategy for evaluating genotype-phenotype relationships when large datasets are scarce or nonexistent is to develop and use knowledge graphs.
Knowledge graphs integrate related-but-different data types, creating a rich but complex data source. 
Examples of biomedical knowledge graphs include the Monarch Graph Database[@doi:10.1093/nar/gkw1128], hetionet[@doi:10.7554/eLife.26726], and PheKnowLator[@doi:10.1101/2020.04.30.071407].
