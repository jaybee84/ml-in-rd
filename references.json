    "abstract": "We propose two novel model architectures for computing continuous vector representations of words from very large data sets. The quality of these representations is measured in a word similarity task, and the results are compared to the previously best performing techniques based on different types of neural networks. We observe large improvements in accuracy at much lower computational cost, i.e. it takes less than a day to learn high quality word vectors from a 1.6 billion words data set. Furthermore, we show that these vectors provide state-of-the-art performance on our test set for measuring syntactic and semantic word similarities.",

    "abstract": "  Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor filters and color blobs. Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to specific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which was expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target dataset.

Using a set of industrial ADMET datasets, we compare neural networks to standard baseline models and analyze multitask learning effects with both random cross-validation and a more relevant temporal validation scheme. We confirm that multitask learning can provide modest benefits over single-task models and show that smaller datasets tend to benefit more than larger datasets from multitask learning. Additionally, we find that adding massive amounts of side information is not guaranteed to improve performance relative to simpler multitask learning. Our results emphasize that multitask effects are highly dataset-dependent, suggesting the use of dataset-specific models to maximize overall performance. ",

In this paper, we give a survey for MTL. First, we classify different MTL algorithms into several categories, including feature learning approach, low-rank approach, task clustering approach, task relation learning approach, and decomposition approach, and then discuss the characteristics of each approach. In order to improve the performance of learning tasks further, MTL can be combined with other learning paradigms including semi-supervised learning, active learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, multi-view learning and graphical models. When the number of tasks is large or the data dimensionality is high, batch MTL models are difficult to handle this situation and online, parallel and distributed MTL models as well as dimensionality reduction and feature hashing are reviewed to reveal their computational and storage advantages. Many real-world applications use MTL to boost their performance and we review representative works. Finally, we present theoretical analyses and discuss several future directions for MTL.",

Increasingly, electronic phenotyping is performed via supervised learning. We investigate the effectiveness of multitask learning for phenotyping using electronic health records (EHR) data. Multitask learning aims to improve model performance on a target task by jointly learning additional auxiliary tasks and has been used in disparate areas of machine learning. However, its utility when applied to EHR data has not been established, and prior work suggests that its benefits are inconsistent. We present experiments that elucidate when multitask learning with neural nets improves performance for phenotyping using EHR data relative to neural nets trained for a single phenotype and to well-tuned logistic regression baselines. We find that multitask neural nets consistently outperform single-task neural nets for rare phenotypes but underperform for relatively more common phenotypes. The effect size increases as more auxiliary tasks are added. Moreover, multitask learning reduces the sensitivity of neural nets to hyperparameter settings for rare phenotypes. Last, we quantify phenotype complexity and find that neural nets trained with or without multitask learning do not improve on simple baselines unless the phenotypes are sufficiently complex. ",

Recently, Few-Shot Learning (FSL) is proposed to tackle this problem. Using prior knowledge, FSL can rapidly generalize to new tasks containing only a few samples with supervised information. In this paper, we conduct a thorough survey to fully understand FSL. Starting from a formal definition of FSL, we distinguish FSL from several relevant machine learning problems. We then point out that the core issue in FSL is that the empirical risk minimized is unreliable. Based on how prior knowledge can be used to handle this core issue, we categorize FSL methods from three perspectives: (i) data, which uses prior knowledge to augment the supervised experience; (ii) model, which uses prior knowledge to reduce the size of the hypothesis space; and (iii) algorithm, which uses prior knowledge to alter the search for the best hypothesis in the given hypothesis space. With this taxonomy, we review and discuss the pros and cons of each category. Promising directions, in the aspects of the FSL problem setups, techniques, applications and theories, are also proposed to provide insights for future research.",

    "abstract": "In the last decades, large datasets of fundus photographs have been collected in diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening networks. Through deep learning, these datasets were used to train automatic detectors for DR and a few other frequent pathologies, with the goal to automate screening. One challenge limits the adoption of such systems so far: automatic detectors ignore rare conditions that ophthalmologists currently detect, such as papilledema or anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. The reason is that standard deep learning requires too many examples of these conditions. However, this limitation can be addressed with few-shot learning, a machine learning paradigm where a classifier has to generalize to a new category not seen in training, given only a few examples of this category. This paper presents a new few-shot learning framework that extends convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained for frequent conditions, with an unsupervised probabilistic model for rare condition detection. It is based on the observation that CNNs often perceive photographs containing the same anomalies as similar, even though these CNNs were trained to detect unrelated conditions. This observation was based on the t-SNE visualization tool, which we decided to incorporate in our probabilistic model. Experiments on a dataset of 164,660 screening examinations from the OPHDIAT screening network show that 37 conditions, out of 41, can be detected with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) greater than 0.8 (average AUC: 0.938). In particular, this framework significantly outperforms other frameworks for detecting rare conditions, including multitask learning, transfer learning and Siamese networks, another few-shot learning solution. We expect these richer predictions to trigger the adoption of automated eye pathology screening, which will revolutionize clinical practice in ophthalmology.",

    "abstract": "Machine-learning models have demonstrated great success in learning complex patterns that enable them to make predictions about unobserved data. In addition to using models for prediction, the ability to interpret what a model has learned is receiving an increasing amount of attention. However, this increased focus has led to considerable confusion about the notion of interpretability. In particular, it is unclear how the wide array of proposed interpretation methods are related and what common concepts can be used to evaluate them. We aim to address these concerns by defining interpretability in the context of machine learning and introducing the predictive, descriptive, relevant (PDR) framework for discussing interpretations. The PDR framework provides 3 overarching desiderata for evaluation: predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy, and relevancy, with relevancy judged relative to a human audience. Moreover, to help manage the deluge of interpretation methods, we introduce a categorization of existing techniques into model-based and post hoc categories, with subgroups including sparsity, modularity, and simulatability. To demonstrate how practitioners can use the PDR framework to evaluate and understand interpretations, we provide numerous real-world examples. These examples highlight the often underappreciated role played by human audiences in discussions of interpretability. Finally, based on our framework, we discuss limitations of existing methods and directions for future work. We hope that this work will provide a common vocabulary that will make it easier for both practitioners and researchers to discuss and choose from the full range of interpretation methods.",

    "abstract": "We present the DeepProfile framework, which learns a variational autoencoder (VAE) network from thousands of publicly available gene expression samples and uses this network to encode a low-dimensional representation (LDR) to predict complex disease phenotypes. To our knowledge, DeepProfile is the first attempt to use deep learning to extract a feature representation from a vast quantity of unlabeled (i.e, lacking phenotype information) expression samples that are not incorporated into the prediction problem. We use Deep-Profile to predict acute myeloid leukemia patients’ responses to 160 chemotherapy drugs. We show that, when compared to the original features (i.e., expression levels) and LDRs from two commonly used dimensionality reduction methods, DeepProfile: (1) better predicts complex phenotypes, (2) better captures known functional gene groups, and (3) better reconstructs the input data. We show that DeepProfile is generalizable to other diseases and phenotypes by using it to predict ovarian cancer patients’ tumor invasion patterns and breast cancer patients’ disease subtypes.",

    "abstract": "One in ten people are affected by rare diseases, and three out of ten children with rare diseases will not live past age five. However, the small market size of individual rare diseases, combined with the time and capital requirements of pharmaceutical R&amp;D, have hindered the development of new drugs for these cases. A promising alternative is drug repurposing, whereby existing FDA-approved drugs might be used to treat diseases different from their original indications. In order to generate drug repurposing hypotheses in a systematic and comprehensive fashion, it is essential to integrate information from across the literature of pharmacology, genetics, and pathology. To this end, we leverage a newly developed knowledge graph, the Global Network of Biomedical Relationships (GNBR). GNBR is a large, heterogeneous knowledge graph comprising drug, disease, and gene (or protein) entities linked by a small set of semantic themes derived from the abstracts of biomedical literature. We apply a knowledge graph embedding method that explicitly models the uncertainty associated with literature-derived relationships and uses link prediction to generate drug repurposing hypotheses. This approach achieves high performance on a gold-standard test set of known drug indications (AUROC = 0.89) and is capable of generating novel repurposing hypotheses, which we independently validate using external literature sources and protein interaction networks. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of our model to produce explanations of its predictions.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is a rare and life-shortening condition often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Despite increased awareness, the delay to diagnosis remains unchanged. This study explores whether a predictive model based on healthcare resource utilisation can be used to screen large populations to identify patients at high risk of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Hospital Episode Statistics from the National Health Service in England, providing close to full national coverage, were used as a measure of healthcare resource utilisation. Data for patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension from the National Pulmonary Hypertension Service in Sheffield were linked to pre-diagnosis Hospital Episode Statistics records. A non-idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension control cohort was selected from the Hospital Episode Statistics population. Patient history was limited to ≤5 years pre-diagnosis. Information on demographics, timing/frequency of diagnoses, medical specialities visited and procedures undertaken was captured. For modelling, a bagged gradient boosting trees algorithm was used to discriminate between cohorts. Between 2008 and 2016, 709 patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension were identified and compared with a stratified cohort of 2,812,458 patients classified as non-idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension with ≥1 ICD-10 coded diagnosis of relevance to idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. A predictive model was developed and validated using cross-validation. The timing and frequency of the clinical speciality seen, secondary diagnoses and age were key variables driving the algorithm’s performance. To identify the 100 patients at highest risk of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, 969 patients would need to be screened with a specificity of 99.99% and sensitivity of 14.10% based on a prevalence of 5.5/million. The positive predictive and negative predictive values were 10.32% and 99.99%, respectively. This study highlights the potential application of artificial intelligence to readily available real-world data to screen for rare diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. This algorithm could provide low-cost screening at a population level, facilitating earlier diagnosis, improved diagnostic rates and patient outcomes. Studies to further validate this approach are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a monogenic syndrome that gives rise to numerous symptoms including cognitive impairment, skeletal abnormalities, and growth of benign nerve sheath tumors. Nearly all NF1 patients develop cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs), which occur on the skin surface, whereas 40–60% of patients develop plexiform neurofibromas (pNFs), which are deeply embedded in the peripheral nerves. Patients with pNFs have a ~10% lifetime chance of these tumors becoming malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). These tumors have a severe prognosis and few treatment options other than surgery. Given the lack of therapeutic options available to patients with these tumors, identification of druggable pathways or other key molecular features could aid ongoing therapeutic discovery studies. In this work, we used statistical and machine learning methods to analyze 77 NF1 tumors with genomic data to characterize key signaling pathways that distinguish these tumors and identify candidates for drug development. We identified subsets of latent gene expression variables that may be important in the identification and etiology of cNFs, pNFs, other neurofibromas, and MPNSTs. Furthermore, we characterized the association between these latent variables and genetic variants, immune deconvolution predictions, and protein activity predictions.",

    "abstract": "The ability to computationally predict whether a compound treats a disease would improve the economy and success rate of drug approval. This study describes Project Rephetio to systematically model drug efficacy based on 755 existing treatments. First, we constructed Hetionet (neo4j.het.io), an integrative network encoding knowledge from millions of biomedical studies. Hetionet v1.0 consists of 47,031 nodes of 11 types and 2,250,197 relationships of 24 types. Data were integrated from 29 public resources to connect compounds, diseases, genes, anatomies, pathways, biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, pharmacologic classes, side effects, and symptoms. Next, we identified network patterns that distinguish treatments from non-treatments. Then, we predicted the probability of treatment for 209,168 compound–disease pairs (het.io/repurpose). Our predictions validated on two external sets of treatment and provided pharmacological insights on epilepsy, suggesting they will help prioritize drug repurposing candidates. This study was entirely open and received realtime feedback from 40 community members.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing interest in developing prediction models capable of identifying rare disease patients in population-scale databases such as electronic health records (EHRs). Deriving these models is challenging for many reasons, perhaps the most important being the limited number of patients with 'gold standard' confirmed diagnoses from which to learn. This paper presents a novel cascade learning methodology which induces accurate prediction models from noisy 'silver standard' labeled data - patients provisionally labeled as positive for the target disease based upon unconfirmed evidence. The algorithm combines unsupervised feature selection, supervised ensemble learning, and unsupervised clustering to enable robust learning from noisy labels. The efficacy of the approach is illustrated through a case study involving the detection of lipodystrophy patients in a country-scale database of EHRs. The case study demonstrates our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art prediction techniques and permits discovery of previously undiagnosed patients in large EHR databases.",
