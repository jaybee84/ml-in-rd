    "abstract": "  We propose two novel model architectures for computing continuous vector representations of words from very large data sets. The quality of these representations is measured in a word similarity task, and the results are compared to the previously best performing techniques based on different types of neural networks. We observe large improvements in accuracy at much lower computational cost, i.e. it takes less than a day to learn high quality word vectors from a 1.6 billion words data set. Furthermore, we show that these vectors provide state-of-the-art performance on our test set for measuring syntactic and semantic word similarities. ",

    "abstract": "Abstract\r\n            Single-cell transcriptomics yields ever growing data sets containing RNA expression levels for thousands of genes from up to millions of cells. Common data analysis pipelines include a dimensionality reduction step for visualising the data in two dimensions, most frequently performed using t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE). It excels at revealing local structure in high-dimensional data, but naive applications often suffer from severe shortcomings, e.g. the global structure of the data is not represented accurately. Here we describe how to circumvent such pitfalls, and develop a protocol for creating more faithful t-SNE visualisations. It includes PCA initialisation, a high learning rate, and multi-scale similarity kernels; for very large data sets, we additionally use exaggeration and downsampling-based initialisation. We use published single-cell RNA-seq data sets to demonstrate that this protocol yields superior results compared to the naive application of t-SNE.",

Yet biological networks, that commonly define such modules are incomplete and biased toward some well-studied disease genes. Here we ask whether disease-relevant modules of genes can be discovered without prior knowledge of a biological network, instead training a deep autoencoder from large transcriptional data. We hypothesize that modules could be discovered within the autoencoder representations. We find a statistically significant enrichment of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) relevant genes in the last layer, and to a successively lesser degree in the middle and first layers respectively. In contrast, we find an opposite gradient where a modular protein–protein interaction signal is strongest in the first layer, but then vanishing smoothly deeper in the network. We conclude that a data-driven discovery approach is sufficient to discover groups of disease-related genes.",

Here, we use the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) method on published transcript profiles of 1484 single gene deletions of\r\n              Saccharomyces cerevisiae\r\n              . Proximity in low-dimensional UMAP space identifies groups of genes that correspond to protein complexes and pathways, and finds novel protein interactions, even within well-characterized complexes. This approach is more sensitive than previous methods and should be broadly useful as additional transcriptome datasets become available for other organisms.",

    "abstract": "Machine-learning models have demonstrated great success in learning complex patterns that enable them to make predictions about unobserved data. In addition to using models for prediction, the ability to interpret what a model has learned is receiving an increasing amount of attention. However, this increased focus has led to considerable confusion about the notion of interpretability. In particular, it is unclear how the wide array of proposed interpretation methods are related and what common concepts can be used to evaluate them. We aim to address these concerns by defining interpretability in the context of machine learning and introducing the predictive, descriptive, relevant (PDR) framework for discussing interpretations. The PDR framework provides 3 overarching desiderata for evaluation: predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy, and relevancy, with relevancy judged relative to a human audience. Moreover, to help manage the deluge of interpretation methods, we introduce a categorization of existing techniques into model-based and post hoc categories, with subgroups including sparsity, modularity, and simulatability. To demonstrate how practitioners can use the PDR framework to evaluate and understand interpretations, we provide numerous real-world examples. These examples highlight the often underappreciated role played by human audiences in discussions of interpretability. Finally, based on our framework, we discuss limitations of existing methods and directions for future work. We hope that this work will provide a common vocabulary that will make it easier for both practitioners and researchers to discuss and choose from the full range of interpretation methods.",

Research is most efficient when those hypotheses are based on the entirety of knowledge known to date. Systematic review articles are commonly used in biomedicine to summarize existing knowledge and contextualize experimental data. But the information contained within review articles is typically only expressed as free-text, which is difficult to use computationally. Researchers struggle to navigate, collect and remix prior knowledge as it is scattered in several silos without seamless integration and access. This lack of a structured information framework hinders research by both experimental and computational scientists. To better organize knowledge and data, we built a structured review article that is specifically focused on NGLY1 Deficiency, an ultra-rare genetic disease first reported in 2012. We represented this structured review as a knowledge graph and then stored this knowledge graph in a Neo4j database to simplify dissemination, querying and visualization of the network. Relative to free-text, this structured review better promotes the principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability (FAIR). In collaboration with domain experts in NGLY1 Deficiency, we demonstrate how this resource can improve the efficiency and comprehensiveness of hypothesis generation. We also developed a read–write interface that allows domain experts to contribute FAIR structured knowledge to this community resource. In contrast to traditional free-text review articles, this structured review exists as a living knowledge graph that is curated by humans and accessible to computational analyses. Finally, we have generalized this workflow into modular and repurposable components that can be applied to other domain areas. This NGLY1 Deficiency-focused network is publicly available at http://ngly1graph.org/.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Availability and implementation\r\n              Database URL: http://ngly1graph.org/.

    "abstract": "Abstract\r\n            Objective Traditionally, patient groups with a phenotype are selected through rule-based definitions whose creation and validation are time-consuming. Machine learning approaches to electronic phenotyping are limited by the paucity of labeled training datasets. We demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing semi-automatically labeled training sets to create phenotype models via machine learning, using a comprehensive representation of the patient medical record.\r\n            Methods We use a list of keywords specific to the phenotype of interest to generate noisy labeled training data. We train L1 penalized logistic regression models for a chronic and an acute disease and evaluate the performance of the models against a gold standard.\r\n            Results Our models for Type 2 diabetes mellitus and myocardial infarction achieve precision and accuracy of 0.90, 0.89, and 0.86, 0.89, respectively. Local implementations of the previously validated rule-based definitions for Type 2 diabetes mellitus and myocardial infarction achieve precision and accuracy of 0.96, 0.92 and 0.84, 0.87, respectively.\r\n            We have demonstrated feasibility of learning phenotype models using imperfectly labeled data for a chronic and acute phenotype. Further research in feature engineering and in specification of the keyword list can improve the performance of the models and the scalability of the approach.\r\n            Conclusions Our method provides an alternative to manual labeling for creating training sets for statistical models of phenotypes. Such an approach can accelerate research with large observational healthcare datasets and may also be used to create local phenotype models.",

    "abstract": "Large datasets are increasingly common and are often difficult to interpret. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss. It does so by creating new uncorrelated variables that successively maximize variance. Finding such new variables, the principal components, reduces to solving an eigenvalue/eigenvector problem, and the new variables are defined by the dataset at hand, not\r\n              a priori\r\n              , hence making PCA an adaptive data analysis technique. It is adaptive in another sense too, since variants of the technique have been developed that are tailored to various different data types and structures. This article will begin by introducing the basic ideas of PCA, discussing what it can and cannot do. It will then describe some variants of PCA and their application.",

We introduce PheKnowLator (Phenotype Knowledge Translator), a novel KG framework and fully automated Python 3 library explicitly designed for optimized construction of semantically-rich, large-scale biomedical KGs. To demonstrate the functionality of the framework, we built and evaluated eight different parameterizations of a large semantic KG of human disease mechanisms. PheKnowLator is available at:\r\n              https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator\r\n              .",

To our knowledge, DeepProfile is the first attempt to use deep learning to extract a feature representation from a vast quantity of unlabeled (i.e, lacking phenotype information) expression samples that are not incorporated into the prediction problem. We use Deep-Profile to predict acute myeloid leukemia patients’\r\n            in vitro\r\n            responses to 160 chemotherapy drugs. We show that, when compared to the original features (i.e., expression levels) and LDRs from two commonly used dimensionality reduction methods, DeepProfile: (1) better predicts complex phenotypes, (2) better captures known functional gene groups, and (3) better reconstructs the input data. We show that DeepProfile is generalizable to other diseases and phenotypes by using it to predict ovarian cancer patients’ tumor invasion patterns and breast cancer patients’ disease subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\r\n            With recent advances in technology, deep sequencing data will be widely used to further the understanding of genetic influence on traits of interest. Therefore not only common variants but also rare variants need to be better used to exploit the new information provided by deep sequencing data. Recently, statistical approaches for analyzing rare variants in genetic association studies have been proposed, but many of them were designed only for dichotomous outcomes. We compare the type I error and power of several statistical approaches applicable to quantitative traits for collapsing and analyzing rare variant data within a defined gene region. In addition to comparing methods that consider only rare variants, such as indicator, count, and data-adaptive collapsing methods, we also compare methods that incorporate the analysis of common variants along with rare variants, such as CMC and LASSO regression. We find that the three methods used to collapse rare variants perform similarly in this simulation setting where all risk variants were simulated to have effects in the same direction. Further, we find that incorporating common variants is beneficial and using a LASSO regression to choose which common variants to include is most useful when there is are few common risk variants compared to the total number of risk variants.",

However, due to the very nature of rare diseases, the lack of historical data poses a great challenge to machine learning-based approaches. On the other hand, medical knowledge in automatically constructed knowledge graphs (KGs) has the potential to compensate the lack of labeled training examples. This work aims to develop a rare disease classification algorithm that makes effective use of a knowledge graph, even when the graph is imperfect.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Method\r\n              We develop a text classification algorithm that represents a document as a combination of a “bag of words” and a “bag of knowledge terms,” where a “knowledge term” is a term shared between the document and the subgraph of KG relevant to the disease classification task. We use two Chinese disease diagnosis corpora to evaluate the algorithm. The first one, HaoDaiFu, contains 51,374 chief complaints categorized into 805 diseases. The second data set, ChinaRe, contains 86,663 patient descriptions categorized into 44 disease categories.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Results\r\n              \r\n                On the two evaluation data sets, the proposed algorithm delivers robust performance and outperforms a wide range of baselines, including resampling, deep learning, and feature selection approaches. Both classification-based metric (macro-averaged\r\n                F\r\n                1\r\n                score) and ranking-based metric (mean reciprocal rank) are used in evaluation.\r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Conclusion\r\n              Medical knowledge in large-scale knowledge graphs can be effectively leveraged to improve rare diseases classification models, even when the knowledge graph is incomplete.",

Currently, there are no systematic reviews that investigate, from a general perspective, how machine learning is used in a rare disease context. This scoping review aims to address this gap and explores the use of machine learning in rare diseases, investigating, for example, in which rare diseases machine learning is applied, which types of algorithms and input data are used or which medical applications (e.g., diagnosis, prognosis or treatment) are studied.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Methods\r\n              Using a complex search string including generic search terms and 381 individual disease names, studies from the past 10 years (2010–2019) that applied machine learning in a rare disease context were identified on PubMed. To systematically map the research activity, eligible studies were categorized along different dimensions (e.g., rare disease group, type of algorithm, input data), and the number of studies within these categories was analyzed.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Results\r\n              Two hundred eleven studies from 32 countries investigating 74 different rare diseases were identified. Diseases with a higher prevalence appeared more often in the studies than diseases with a lower prevalence. Moreover, some rare disease groups were investigated more frequently than to be expected (e.g., rare neurologic diseases and rare systemic or rheumatologic diseases), others less frequently (e.g., rare inborn errors of metabolism and rare skin diseases). Ensemble methods (36.0%), support vector machines (32.2%) and artificial neural networks (31.8%) were the algorithms most commonly applied in the studies. Only a small proportion of studies evaluated their algorithms on an external data set (11.8%) or against a human expert (2.4%). As input data, images (32.2%), demographic data (27.0%) and “omics” data (26.5%) were used most frequently. Most studies used machine learning for diagnosis (40.8%) or prognosis (38.4%) whereas studies aiming to improve treatment were relatively scarce (4.7%). Patient numbers in the studies were small, typically ranging from 20 to 99 (35.5%).\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Conclusion\r\n              Our review provides an overview of the use of machine learning in rare diseases. Mapping the current research activity, it can guide future work and help to facilitate the successful application of machine learning in rare diseases.",

However, these algorithms require a user to select a biologically appropriate latent space dimensionality. In practice, most researchers fit a single algorithm and latent dimensionality. We sought to determine the extent by which selecting only one fit limits the biological features captured in the latent representations and, consequently, limits what can be discovered with subsequent analyses.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Results\r\n              We compress gene expression data from three large datasets consisting of adult normal tissue, adult cancer tissue, and pediatric cancer tissue. We train many different models across a large range of latent space dimensionalities and observe various performance differences. We identify more curated pathway gene sets significantly associated with individual dimensions in denoising autoencoder and variational autoencoder models trained using an intermediate number of latent dimensionalities. Combining compressed features across algorithms and dimensionalities captures the most pathway-associated representations. When trained with different latent dimensionalities, models learn strongly associated and generalizable biological representations including sex, neuroblastoma MYCN amplification, and cell types. Stronger signals, such as tumor type, are best captured in models trained at lower dimensionalities, while more subtle signals such as pathway activity are best identified in models trained with more latent dimensionalities.\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              Conclusions\r\n              There is no single best latent dimensionality or compression algorithm for analyzing gene expression data. Instead, using features derived from different compression models across multiple latent space dimensionalities enhances biological representations.",

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a monogenic syndrome that gives rise to numerous symptoms including cognitive impairment, skeletal abnormalities, and growth of benign nerve sheath tumors. Nearly all NF1 patients develop cutaneous neurofibromas (cNFs), which occur on the skin surface, whereas 40–60% of patients develop plexiform neurofibromas (pNFs), which are deeply embedded in the peripheral nerves. Patients with pNFs have a ~10% lifetime chance of these tumors becoming malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). These tumors have a severe prognosis and few treatment options other than surgery. Given the lack of therapeutic options available to patients with these tumors, identification of druggable pathways or other key molecular features could aid ongoing therapeutic discovery studies. In this work, we used statistical and machine learning methods to analyze 77 NF1 tumors with genomic data to characterize key signaling pathways that distinguish these tumors and identify candidates for drug development. We identified subsets of latent gene expression variables that may be important in the identification and etiology of cNFs, pNFs, other neurofibromas, and MPNSTs. Furthermore, we characterized the association between these latent variables and genetic variants, immune deconvolution predictions, and protein activity predictions.",

    "abstract": "The ability to computationally predict whether a compound treats a disease would improve the economy and success rate of drug approval. This study describes Project Rephetio to systematically model drug efficacy based on 755 existing treatments. First, we constructed Hetionet (neo4j.het.io), an integrative network encoding knowledge from millions of biomedical studies. Hetionet v1.0 consists of 47,031 nodes of 11 types and 2,250,197 relationships of 24 types. Data were integrated from 29 public resources to connect compounds, diseases, genes, anatomies, pathways, biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components, pharmacologic classes, side effects, and symptoms. Next, we identified network patterns that distinguish treatments from non-treatments. Then, we predicted the probability of treatment for 209,168 compound–disease pairs (het.io/repurpose). Our predictions validated on two external sets of treatment and provided pharmacological insights on epilepsy, suggesting they will help prioritize drug repurposing candidates. This study was entirely open and received realtime feedback from 40 community members.\r\n          , \r\n            Of all the data in the world today, 90% was created in the last two years. However, taking advantage of this data in order to advance our knowledge is restricted by how quickly we can access it and analyze it in a proper context.\r\n            In biomedical research, data is largely fragmented and stored in databases that typically do not “talk” to each other, thus hampering progress. One particular problem in medicine today is that the process of making a new therapeutic drug from scratch is incredibly expensive and inefficient, making it a risky business. Given the low success rate in drug discovery, there is an economic incentive in trying to repurpose an existing drug that has already been shown to be safe and effective towards a new disease or condition.\r\n            Himmelstein et al. used a computational approach to analyze 50,000 data points – including drugs, diseases, genes and symptoms – from 19 different public databases. This approach made it possible to create more than two million relationships among the data points, which could be used to develop models that predict which drugs currently in use by doctors might be best suited to treat any of 136 common diseases. For example, Himmelstein et al. identified specific drugs currently used to treat depression and alcoholism that could be repurposed to treat smoking addition and epilepsy.\r\n            These findings provide a new and powerful way to study drug repurposing. While this work was exclusively performed with public data, an expanded and potentially stronger set of predictions could be obtained if data owned by pharmaceutical companies were incorporated. Additional studies will be needed to test the predictions made by the models.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing interest in developing prediction models capable of identifying rare disease patients in population-scale databases such as electronic health records (EHRs). Deriving these models is challenging for many reasons, perhaps the most important being the limited number of patients with 'gold standard' confirmed diagnoses from which to learn. This paper presents a novel cascade learning methodology which induces accurate prediction models from noisy 'silver standard' labeled data - patients provisionally labeled as positive for the target disease based upon unconfirmed evidence. The algorithm combines unsupervised feature selection, supervised ensemble learning, and unsupervised clustering to enable robust learning from noisy labels. The efficacy of the approach is illustrated through a case study involving the detection of lipodystrophy patients in a country-scale database of EHRs. The case study demonstrates our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art prediction techniques and permits discovery of previously undiagnosed patients in large EHR databases.",

    "abstract": "We propose a manifold alignment based approach for heterogeneous domain adaptation. A key aspect of this approach is to construct mappings to link different feature spaces in order to transfer knowledge across domains. The new approach can reuse labeled data from multiple source domains in a target domain even in the case when the input domains do not share any common features or instances. As a pre-processing step, our approach can also be combined with existing domain adaptation approaches to learn a common feature space for all input domains. This paper extends existing manifold alignment approaches by making use of labels rather than correspondences to align the manifolds. This extension significantly broadens the application scope of manifold alignment, since the correspondence relationship required by existing alignment approaches is hard to obtain in many applications.",

    "abstract": "We present a new technique called \"t-SNE\" that visualizes\nhigh-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or\nthree-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic\nNeighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize,\nand produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the\ntendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is\nbetter than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals\nstructure at many different scales. This is particularly important for\nhigh-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related,\nlow-dimensional manifolds, such as images ofobjects from multiple\nclasses seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure\nof very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on\nneighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data\nto influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We\nillustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and\ncompare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques,\nincluding Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The\nvisualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those\nproduced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.",

    "abstract": "Data sharing anchors reproducible science, but expectations and best practices are often nebulous. Communities of funders, researchers and publishers continue to grapple with what should be required or encouraged. To illuminate the rationales for sharing data, the technical challenges and the social and cultural challenges, we consider the stakeholders in the scientific enterprise. In biomedical research, participants are key among those stakeholders. Ethical sharing requires considering both the value of research efforts and the privacy costs for participants. We discuss current best practices for various types of genomic data, as well as opportunities to promote ethical data sharing that accelerates science by aligning incentives.",
